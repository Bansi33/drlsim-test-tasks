# DRLSim Test Tasks / Project Folder
  
This folder must contain your solution for the assignment.
It goes without saying, but be mindful about the following aspects:
  
* Folder organization.
* Clean and concise naming conventions.
* Script architecture and planning.
    
## First Steps
* Copy over the ```test-01-base``` scene from the ```/Core``` folder.
* Rename it as ```test-01```
* The scene offers the smallest boilerplate for development.
* Just keep the fps tracking prefab as is.
* Feel free to employ any desired organization in the scene's hierarchy.
* Picture as other team members will be working with you.
